The solution is to remove the `count` from the dependency array of `useCallback`.  Since `setCount` implicitly uses the latest value of `count`, there is no need to include it as a dependency.  The corrected code looks like this:

```javascript
import React, { useState, useCallback } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const increment = useCallback(() => {
    setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1); // Use functional update
  }, []); // No dependency needed

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{count}</Text>
      <Button title="Increment" onPress={increment} />
    </View>
  );
};

```

By using a functional update with `setCount`, we guarantee that `increment` always uses the most up-to-date value of `count`.  Removing `count` from the dependency array ensures that `useCallback` returns the same function reference throughout the component's lifecycle unless the increment function's definition changes. This prevents stale closures.
