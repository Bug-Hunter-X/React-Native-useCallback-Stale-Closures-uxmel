This error occurs when using the `useCallback` hook in React Native with a function that relies on a state variable.  The problem is that even though the function itself is memoized by `useCallback`, if its dependencies (the state variable) changes, a new memoized function is created, leading to unexpected behavior. For example, consider this code:

```javascript
import React, { useState, useCallback } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const increment = useCallback(() => {
    setCount(count + 1);
  }, [count]); // Incorrect dependency

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{count}</Text>
      <Button title="Increment" onPress={increment} />
    </View>
  );
};

```

The dependency `[count]` here is problematic.  Every time the count changes, a new `increment` function is created, even though it's logically the same.

This can lead to stale closures where the `increment` function uses an outdated value of `count`.
